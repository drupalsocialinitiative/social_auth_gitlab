INTRODUCTION
------------

Social Auth Gitlab Module is a Gitlab Authentication integration for Drupal.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following modules:

 * Social Auth (https://drupal.org/project/social_auth)
 * Social API (https://drupal.org/project/social_api)


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Run composer to install dependencies:
   composer require "drupal/social_auth_gitlab"

 * Install the dependencies: Social API and Social Auth.

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
   for further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * Add your Gitlab project OAuth information in
   Configuration » User Authentication » Gitlab.

 * Place a Social Auth Gitlab block in Structure » Block Layout.

 * If you already have a Social Auth Login block in the site, rebuild the
   cache.


HOW IT WORKS
------------

User can click on the Gitlab logo in the Social Auth Login block.
You can also add a button or link anywhere on the site that points
to /user/login/gitlab, so theming and customizing the button or link
is very flexible.

When the user opens the /user/login/gitlab link, it automatically takes
user to Gitlab for authentication. Gitlab then returns the user to Drupal site.
If we have an existing Drupal user with the same email address provided by
Gitlab, that user is logged in. Otherwise, a new Drupal user is
created.
